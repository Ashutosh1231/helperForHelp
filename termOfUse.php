        "Platform"), as well as the services provided on or through the Platform (referred to collectively as

        the "Services"). The Terms also include our privacy policy available at [https://broomees.com/

        privacy], as well as any additional guidelines, terms, policies, and disclaimers that we may issue

        from time to time ("Supplemental Terms"). The Privacy Policy and Supplemental Terms are integral

        parts of these Terms. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Supplemental Terms

        regarding the applicable Services, the Supplemental Terms will take precedence.

        These Terms establish a legally binding contract between Broomees India Private Limited and its

        affiliates (referred to as "Broomees," "we," "us," or "our"), and you, as a user of the Services or a

        legal entity booking Services on behalf of end-users (referred to as "you" or "User"). By utilising

        the Services, you confirm that you have the legal capacity and authority to agree to and be bound by

        these Terms. If you are representing another person or entity, you affirm that you possess the

        necessary authority to bind them to these Terms.

        Your use of the Services indicates your acknowledgement, understanding, and agreement to abide

        by these Terms, as amended periodically. These Terms override any previous written agreements. If

        you do not agree with these Terms or cannot comply with their provisions, please refrain from using

        the Services.

        "By submitting our webform while booking the Services, you agree to receive promotional calls and

        communications on the number shared, and such communication and SMS may be coming from a

        third-party platform."
